# AWS Cloud WAN - Infrastructure as Code Examples

AWS Cloud WAN is a managed wide-area networking (WAN) service that you can use to build, manage, and monitor an unified global network that connects resources running across your cloud and on-premises environments. It provides a central dashboard from which you can connect on-premises branch offices, data centers, and Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) across the AWS global network. You can use simple network policies to centrally configure and automate network management and security tasks, and get a complete view of your global network.

This repository shows you an example of global communication with AWS Cloud WAN, showing the same architecture you can build in the [AWS Cloud WAN Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/cloudwan/en-US) using different Infrastructure as Code (IaC) frameworks: CloudFormation, CDK (with Typescript and Python examples) and Terraform.

Choices which region you want to deploy it to. **This version will completely build out the entire infrastructure without having to remove the # from the original repo.**
* [Terraform](./terraform/) - Original
* [Terraform](./terraform-ohio-oregon/) - Deploys to Ohio and Oregon
* [Terraform](./terraform-stockholm-oregon/) - Deploys to Stockholm and Oregon

**NOTE**: The resources created incur costs in your AWS Account. Consider deleting the resources created once your tests are done. For more information, check the [AWS Cloud WAN pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-wan/pricing/).
